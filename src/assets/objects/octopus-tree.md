## _I_ am the _Octopus Tree_.  
### Let me tell you a story that is conveniently written in a first person perspective...

Yeah yeah, so that's that. Now then, let's talk about my life and how it got to this point.

I was raised in a normal family, went to a normal school, and had normal friends. But _then_ the Fire Nation attacked...

So anyway, starting from when things got interesting to tell about:  
I really wanted to study Architecture after middelbare school, so I did. With my cum laude graduation I could get a wildcard into any university, but I didn't really need that as they would just let in anyone at the TU Delft Architecture faculty. Hah.  
And it was fantastic... at least for the first while. I loved designing buildings that were as cool as possible and integrating every little conceptual detail into a comprehensive and technically viable solution. And well, let's say that my grades reflected my passion.  
Then the second year came and we started to work with 3D software Rhinoceros + Grasshopper, which allowed for some very advanced 3D scripting. Wowzers! I had already used this at the end of high school for my profielwerkstuk and got _way_ into it, working sometimes 18 hours in a single day, and got another `10`. Yay~!

Okay, but then Architecture (btw I'm apparently not supposed to capitalise it) got less captivating. The project got more bureaucratic and accounting of circumstances like finances, government regulations and 'what the gemiddelde Nederlander wants'. My grades also dropped like a bomb (no they didn't, I still graduated cum laude).  
The point is, I slowly lost my passion for Architecture and still had to come to the realisation that making something that has to eventually exist in the real world just isn't for me.

Then I went on an exchange semester to the University of Bath and took one large(-ish) Computer Science module. Which, you know how it goes, completely enticed me.  
This is what made me realise just how much all programming-like things I had done in my life I had enjoyed and how much I wanted this to continue for the rest of my life.  
So yes, at this point I actually wanted to quit Architecture just one semester before attaining my bachelor.  
Which I did not do, but from that point on I have continued to spend a significant amount of my time on programming-related things and loved (almost: think hours of bugfixing for a single stupidly simple bug, the usual story) every second of it.  

And that brings me to the point where I graduated Architecture and went on to a 10 week webdev bootcamp called Codaisseur, which has the same moustache as the very tree that is telling this story. Codaisseur basically _promises_ graduates to get a job in web development / programming, so I figured this would be a good 'shortcut' to get into the field.

So yes. And indeed, the shortcut worked! Because of my immense passion for coding / the fact that it was woven deeply(-ish) into my everyday life (think: small hobby ideas, scripts to automate parts of my life, or things that actually benefit other people (okay maybe putting all these in plural is a bit much but oh well); hashtag learn something new every day, right? No I'm not hip like that so no hashtag this time.)  
,  
the job searching did at least go somewhat smoothly. Yay! ヽ(;^o^ヽ)

And _that_ brings me to today: I am working at a lovely little / not so little company/agency called [Q42](https://q42.nl). If you want to know about my adventure at the company that uses the ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything in their name like it's nothing, please... _check back in a couple years or sth, as I probably won't feel like updating this text for a while from now_. Hah.


Programming has proven to be for me, the ideal alternative to this dumb thing called _'society'_ （　´∀｀）

For a sample of my 'best' work in Architecture, I included a Project about it in the Projects stack.
