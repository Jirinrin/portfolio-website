## Hi, I'm Jiri's _SOUL_~~~

This is the core of being that determines my every action.  
She is the cake to the tart, the creme to the femme, the crocket to the biscuit, you get the picture.

As you could probably tell from how she looks, she is really just a child, who always makes me discard ratio in favour of intuition when it comes down to it.  
I like to think that my SOUL's neverending wonder at what life can be like and willingness to absorb as much as she can, truly gives me the power to always continue to develop myself and put as much passion into projects as I do~~~
