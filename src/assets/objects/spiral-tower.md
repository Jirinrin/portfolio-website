# My code and me

There are a bunch of principles that define me as a programmer.  
In the text below this I've categorised these in two _'sides'_.

## The technical fetishist

I think of programming as an art. When I have the time for it I love to refactor code multiple times, to become extremely elegant and readable. I also get a lot of satisfaction out of making systems more and more intelligent/efficient.  
This side is also the one that loves to analyse the world in order to contribute to it: e.g. it's really fulfilling for me to become deeply familiar with a hugely complex system and then be able to actually contribute to it. Or, the one that completely drools over the implications of a newly introduced programming concept.

## The daydreamer

Sometimes the way I look at code is as a means to realise an end. I sometimes have the craziest ideas, or rather, with any project that I get deep into I see all these possibilities of things that could be added or changed etc. to make it better or more interesting...  
This is the side that sometimes makes me get into a frenzy of coding a project with 20 editor tabs open at the same time, writing all of them at the same time to just realise what I want to achieve as quickly as possible. And then comes the technical fetishist, to actually make the code 'good'. It's quite a good combination, these two sides!
