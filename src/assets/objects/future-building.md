# The future of JIRI

Right, so remember that I currently have a job? No? Not even from throwing a can (blik) at my LinkedIn? Well anyway, I have various ambitious in life, which means that I'm probably not going to stay at the same job forever.  
These are some things I endaveour to realise in the future:

### Go deeper into CS

Yea I know right? Circle Size is such an underrated thing to get good at innit!  
But without further kidding, the pleasure that I experienced from getting an understanding of how computers work at a lower level / understanding complex algorithms etc has shown me that I really want to get deeper and deeper into what is normally only the domain of Computer Science graduates.  
And yes, this _could_ mean that I eventually want to get a bachelor in Computer Science, but it could also mean that I would naturally transition into more and more technically demanding work to continue to intellectually challenge myself! (After all, just, like, learning a certain technology and doing the same stuff/flow over and over is not going to suffice, as experience has shown...)

### Make a game

So I've also got this creative side to me, which has been around since my childhood (e.g. drawing levels for board games with 'cool ideas' (probably not that cool but at the time it was)) and has continued to express itself in the time that I studied Architecture.  
Now I've come to the realisation that what I want to create is things that are 'as impossible as possible', i.e. things that cannot exist in the real world.  
As I'm envisioning it now, this means I should get into game development: games are environments in which it is possible to create a sense of immersion in a fantastical world, and they are also highly complex products that have so many sides to them that I'll never get bored of coding them.  
So yeah, this is certainly going to appear in my life in some form or another (could just be hobby side-projects) in the near-ish future.
