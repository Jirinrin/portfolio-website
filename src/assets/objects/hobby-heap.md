# The exultance of existence

If there is one saying I do _not_ live by, it's 二兎追う者は一兎も得ず:  
I'm constantly jumping about between things to do in my free time (including coding?), meaning that I'll prolly never get exceptionally good at _one_ thing...  
But I dunno, I think I like it this way～

Among things I like are:
- **Cute stuff**: 
- **Music**: 
- **Fashion**:
- **Japan**: No I definitely do _not_ actually understand the Japanese words that are scattered over this site, what are you talking about....
- **Quiet places**:
- **Nerdy things**
- **Coding**: Ohkay, I thought I might as well include it in this list, as I do spend a lot of my time just coding for fun...
- **Art**
