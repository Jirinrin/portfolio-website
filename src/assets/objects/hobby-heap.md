# The exultance of existence

If there is one saying I do _not_ live by, it's 二兎追う者は一兎も得ず:  
I'm constantly jumping about between things to do in my free time (including coding?), meaning that I'll prolly never get exceptionally good at _one_ thing...  
But I dunno, I don't think I mind it like this～

Among things I like are:

**`Cute stuff`**  
I like cute things. And cute people. Are you cute today?

**`Music`**  
Music is love && live && Love Live (hahah). Please don't (or do) ask me about all the genres of music that I listen to, because then I'll feel as though I need to properly give everything its own proper place in my expression and I'll get _real_ stressed out trying to come up with a good comprehensive answer.  
What this fact does is it gives an indication of my passion for the field. Which is huge.
I also _'have'_ this cool audio interface + midi keyboard + condenser mic combo setup, that to this day I have barely used for actually producing music.... (o(╥﹏╥)o)  
If you're interested in the ~2 tracks I made back in the day, I can send you the link to my SoundCloud.

**`Fashion`**  
Ya I reckon you're not gonna find many recent pictures of me online, so you'll have to meet me IRL to get a real sense of my _acquired_ style.  
But to put it simply: it's about looking _not Western-like_ (to be more specific, mostly Asian styles (both 'relativelyNormal'/street and the crazy Japanese stuff)), and mixing things that definitely weren't intended for one another.  

**`Japan`**  
No I definitely do _not_ actually _understand_ the Japanese words that are scattered over this site, what are you talking about....  
I all seriousness though, since I got into it 4~5 years ago, Japan is to this day still the country that entices me the most and I do not at all regret having taken (/ still taking) the time to learn its language!

**`Fantasy`**  
I'm always very much attracted to worlds that defy the common sense and have this unique feel to them...  The normal world just gets so dull sometimes...  
Damn I really need SAO-type VR in my life right meow

**`Quiet places`**  
Quiet places (which can refer to just my house, but also a lonely arbour in a public garden or a forgotten pathway in the mountains) are an important underlying `const` in my life, as my introversion only allows me to be around people for so long before I _really_ need to recharge.  
I'd probably be best off just becoming a hermit later in life...

**`Nerdy things`**  
'Nerd' is probably one of the easiest words to describe me. I'm a junky for cool technology, like to get into the nitty-gritty of seemingly 'uninteresting' things and am still a large fan of using free time to play games and watch anime / read manga.

**`Coding`**  
Ohkay, I thought I might as well include it in this list, as I do spend a lot of my time just coding for fun...

**`Art`**  
It's not really as if I'm in the art community or anything, so this one is a big vague, but Idunno, I just _like_ art-related things or sth...  
I also draw some digital art from time to time with my Wacom tablet that I also use to place [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) (excellent segway: go play the game it's great, you're _definitely_ not going to get WAY to addicted to it I _promise_.... not.).

**`カラオケ`**  
No, not karaoke, only カラオケ.

**`Rhythm games`**  
This probably falls under things that are 'nerdy', but whatever, so does coding.  
Rhythm games are a thing that I'm somewhere between passionate (about) and addicted to.  
The two games I feel sort of confident in my skill in are osu! and DDR, but I do also want to learn games like JuBeat, Taiko no Tatsujin, Sound Voltex, Dancerush Stardom, Beatmania IIDX, etc.etc. Too bad that I don't have the peripherals for those, hahah.

**_Aside_**: For a more ~cutely styled~ approach to describing these things that are supposed to be my passions in life, I would recommend looking at my [First Evarr Website](https://modest-ritchie-26c33d.netlify.com/) (also find it in the Projects stack)
