# ;;;;;;;;

`;;;;;;;;` (or _'Semicolon Spammer'_) is an extension for Visual Studio Code I made in my free time during the Codaisseur Academy (and am still maintaining/updating from time to time). It's written in Typescript and was a lot of fun to figure out~

The reason I made the extension is that I love semicolons in code and want them all over my JavaScript code. So, since I couldn't find a good extension that does what I want it to, I decided to make it myself!  
It started as just a command to place/remove a/the semicolon at the end of the current line, and then I wanted to make it more and more intelligent so that you can basically select your whole document and do a `Ctrl+;` and count on that it placed semicolons where you would normally want them...

So yes, over the days I added more and more features that I discovered I need while actually using the extension, and at the moment it's a tool I can barely code without ヽ(*≧ω≦)ﾉ  
And there are still some large future plans, e.g. to make it play better into VSCode's system of filetypes and commands, and to make it work *well* with languages that are syntactically similar to Javascript (which is quite a few).
