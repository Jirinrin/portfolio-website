# First evarrr website

For the Codaisseur Code Academy, we were asked to make a web page introducing ourselves. This is what I came up with.  
I went with a *certain* aesthetic. Hahah. Not too unsatisfied with how it came out.  
Though I wanted to make it spiffy and responsive, but then the whole thing started to die slowly as some small glitchings caused the whole page to look like crap  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I did remove most of the social media links for privacy reasons.
