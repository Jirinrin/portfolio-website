This website started as some _really_ wild thoughts in my head and gradually came down to most of the form that it is now over the course of an (intense) week.  
I felt that I needed to complete this project before I could properly apply for jobs, so this was a bit of a race against the clock to create...

But yeah, I now have a pretty nice ecosystem where if I want to add a project I can just add it to the JSON-like object for that and add a MarkDown file and some images and it sets itself up automatically!
